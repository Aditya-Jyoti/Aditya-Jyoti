## About Me

Hey my name's Aditya but I go by the alias of **Toady** on the internet. I started programming in **March of 2020** with python and have since feel in love with it.
My goal is to become a **software engineer**, in paticular in the **backend web development** industry or something to do with programming logic.
I love building and breaking things and **mechatronics** is a hobby I have not yet invested in.

## Languages I am comfortable in (decreasing order)
